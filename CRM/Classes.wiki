= Classes =

All code in Cool is organized into classes. Each class definition must be contained in a single source file, but multiple classes may be defined in the same file. Class definitions have the form:
{{{
class <type> [ inherits <type> ] {
	<feature_list>
};
}}}
The notation [ ... ] denotes an optional construct. All class names are globally visible. Class names begin with an uppercase letter. Classes may not be redefined.
