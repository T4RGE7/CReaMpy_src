=== Conditionals ===

A conditional has the form
{{{
if <expr> then <expr> else <expr> fi
}}}
The semantics of conditionals is standard. The predicate is evaluated first. If the predicate is $\rm true$, then the $\rm then$ branch is evaluated. If the predicate is $\rm false$, then the $\rm else$ branch is evaluated. The value of the conditional is the value of the evaluated branch.

The predicate must have static type $\rm Bool$. The branches may have any static types. To specify the static type of the conditional, we define an operation $\sqcup$ (pronounced "join") on types as follows. Let $\rm A,B,D$ be any types other than $\rm SELF\_TYPE$. The $\it least\ type$ of a set of types means the least element with respect to the conformance relation $\leq$. 
{{$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tt A \sqcup B &=& \tt the\ least\ type\ C\ such\ that\ A \leq C\ and\ B \leq C \\
\tt A \sqcup A &=& \tt A\ \hphantom{the least}(idempotent) \\
\tt A \sqcup B &=& \tt B \sqcup A\ \hphantom{the le}(commutative) \\
\tt SELF\_TYPE_D \sqcup A &=& \tt D \sqcup A
\end{eqnarray*}
}}$
Let $\rm T$ and $\rm F$ be the static types of the branches of the conditional. Then the static type of the conditional is  $\tt T \sqcup F$. (think: Walk towards $\rm Object$ from each of $\rm T$ and $\rm F$ until the paths meet.)
