== Loops ==

A loop has the form
{{{
while <expr> loop <expr> pool
}}}
The predicate is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the predicate is $\rm false$, the loop terminates and $\rm void$ is returned. If the predicate is $\rm true$, the body of the loop is evaluated and the process repeats.

The predicate must have static type $\rm Bool$. The body may have any static type. The static type of a loop expression is $\rm Object$.
