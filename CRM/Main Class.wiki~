=== Main Class ===

Every program must have a class $\rm Main$. Furthermore, the $\rm Main$ class must have a method $\rm main$ that takes no formal parameters. The $\rm main$ method may be defined in class $\rm Main$ or it may be inherited from another class. A program is executed by evaluating $\rm (new Main).main()$.

The remaining sections of this manual provide a more formal definition of Cool. There are four sections covering lexical structure (Section [[Lexical Structure|10]]), grammar (Section [[Cool Syntax|11]]), type rules (Section [[Type Rules|12]]), and operational semantics (Section [[Operational Semantics|13]]).
