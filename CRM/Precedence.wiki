=== Precedence ===

The precedence of infix binary and prefix unary operations, from highest to lowest, is given by the following table:
{{{
.
@
~
isvoid
* /
+ -
<=  <  =
not
<-
}}}
All binary operations are left-associative, with the exception of assignment, which is right-associative, and the three comparison operations, which do not associate.
