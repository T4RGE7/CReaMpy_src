= Void =

All variables in Cool are initialized to contain values of the appropriate type. The special value $\rm void$ is a member of all types and is used as the default initialization for variables where no initialization is supplied by the user. ($\rm void$ is used where one would use $\rm NULL$ in C or $\rm null$ in Java; Cool does not have anything equivalent to C's or Java's $\rm void$ type.) Note that there is no name for $\rm void$ in Cool; the only way to create a $\rm void$ value is to declare a variable of some class other than $\rm Int$, $\rm String$, or $\rm Bool$ and allow the default initialization to occur, or to store the result of a $\rm while$ loop.

There is a special form $\rm isvoid\ expr$ that tests whether a value is $\rm void$ (see Section 7.11). In addition, $\rm void$ values may be tested for equality. A $\rm void$ value may be passed as an argument, assigned to a variable, or otherwise used in any context where any value is legitimate, except that a dispatch to or case on $\rm void$ generates a runtime error.

Variables of the basic classes $\rm Int$, $\rm Bool$, and $\rm String$ are initialized specially; see Section 8.
